Command symbol changes shells symbols. First argument represents symbol name
and second argument represents new symbol. If command is called with only
first argument, it prints current symbol.

Shell symbols:
PROMPTSYMBOL - symbol on a display screen indicating that the shell is
waiting for input

MORELINESSYMBOL - each line that is not the last line of command must end
with this symbol that is used to inform the shell that more lines is
expected

MULTILINESYMBOL - shell writes this symbol at the beginning followed by a
single whitespace for each line that is part of multi-line command (except
for the first one)
