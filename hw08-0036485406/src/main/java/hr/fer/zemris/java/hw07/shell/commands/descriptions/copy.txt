The copy command expects two arguments: source file name and destination file
name (i.e. paths and names). Is destination file exists, shell asks user is
it allowed to overwrite it. Copy command works only with files (no
directories). If the second argument is directory, shell assumes that user
wants to copy the original file into that directory using the original file
name.
