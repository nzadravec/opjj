cptree PATH1 PATH2
Command copys the tree of PATH1. Let PATH1 is of form something/name1 and
inside there is for example file1.txt, PATH2 is of form
somethingelse/name2/name3. If somethingelse/name2/ime3 exists on disk, then
it creates subdirectory name1 and continues to copy content, so that
somethingelse/name2/name3/name1/file1.txt will arise. If
somethingelse/name2/name3 does not exist but there is somethingelse/name2,
the intrpretation is that the directory name1 wants to be copied under the
name3 so it will be copied, ie it will appear
somethingelse/name2/name3/file1.txt. If there is no somethingelse/name2/name3
and nsomethingelse/name2, the command fails and nothing is copied. Given
paths are initially resolved with respect to the current directory (command
pwd).
